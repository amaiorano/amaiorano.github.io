Welcome to my new blog! I wanted to try out this [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) thing, and I must say, it's really cool! If you're a programmer looking to host a blog, Jekyll's awesome - especially given that GitHub natively supports it.

My old blog, on [Blogspot](https://vgcoding.blogspot.com/), will be kept around for archival purposes, mostly for the posts on [Zelda DS](https://vgcoding.blogspot.com/p/about-zelda-ds.html). But I decided to copy over one post, [Virtual Functions in C]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2014-03-14-virtual-functions-in-c %}), since it's the only one that's programming-specific.

I'm not exactly sure yet what I'll be blog about here. Probably thoughts on programing topics, as well as personal project-related stuff. I guess we'll see!

Thanks for reading :)
