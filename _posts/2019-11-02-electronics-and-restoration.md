Over the past summer, I started watching a bunch of [The 8-bit Guy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8uT9cgJorJPWu7ITLGo9Ww) videos, and became particularly interested in his [many restoration projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_vpfBJZ7JI&list=PLfABUWdDse7YTMY-iEOyHSp8K-6PDSsAs). I also started following a few more YouTubers who do a great job at showcasing electronics and repairs, such as [My Mate Vince](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChY9Cgv-iyPDvf1Bkyx20OQ), [RetroRepairs](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCclt_FYsR8R_fMFXOuUjFEA), and [Odd Tinkering](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf_suVrG2dA5BTjJhNLwthQ).

I've always been more of a software person myself, and although I was interested enough in hardware to write low-enough level code to make games and emulators, I'd never actually gotten into electronics. But after watching these YouTubers clean up old computers, replace worn out capacitors, and rewire controllers, I thought it looked really fun, and perhaps something I could do myself.

So the first thing I realized is that I didn't have any good space in my home to do this kind of thing. After speaking to my wife about it - who, by the way, has an Electrical Engineering degree - she became as excited as I was at the prospect of building a cool hacker space for us to work in. Over the course of a couple of weeks, we cleared out our very messy garage, installed some really awesome [LED workshop lights](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B07M5SP78X/ref=pe_3034960_236394800_TE_dp_1), bought a workbench, as well as some tools we were missing, and made a pretty awesome place for us to work:

I've already completed a few projects, and will be blogging about them soon. One thing to keep in mind is that I am most certainly not an expert, so it's likely that what I share on this blog isn't necessarily the best or right way to do things. So along with my successes, I plan to share my mistakes, and what I learned from them, as these can be even more valuable. Anyway, just wanted to make that disclaimer. Stay tuned!
