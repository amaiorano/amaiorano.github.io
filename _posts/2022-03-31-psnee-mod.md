I bought a used but unmodified PlayStation 1 a couple years ago for about $20. Unlike many PS1s of the era, it didn't have a modchip installed, so it wouldn't play games burned to CDs. I looked around and found this very cool project called [PsNee](https://github.com/kalymos/PsNee). What's neat about this project is that you get to build your own modchip using an Arduino board, and the code that it runs is open-source!

So I bought a clone Arduino Pro Mini @8Mhz and an FT232RL driver to flash the Pro Mini and got to work.

## The Build

First I took the PS1 apart and cleaned everything:

Then following [the guide](https://github.com/kalymos/PsNee/blob/master/PsNee%20modchip%20installation%20guide.pdf), I soldered two wires underneath the PCB:

And four more on the top (this photo only shows three, I soldered the fourth one later):

At this point, I decided to test everything using an Arduino Uno before flashing the mini, first with an authentic game disc:

Then with a copied disc:

Success! Now it was time to configure the Pro Mini. I connected the pin headers and wires following [this guide](https://alselectro.wordpress.com/2017/05/14/arduino-pro-mini-how-to-upload-code/) to upload the PsNee firmware to the ProMini:

Then I soldered all six wires to the Pro Mini board:

As I had the same colored wire, and this was my first time attempting this kind of project, I labeled each wire. In retrospect, this wasn't really necessary. One more test, and it worked:

Now it was time to close up the console. I put the PCB back in the case, and used a twist tie to wrap up the wires:

I put some wire tape over the board to avoid shorts and tucked the whole thing in the space at the front-right when facing the PS1:

Closed up the console and one final test:

## Thoughts

This was a really fun project! The original PS1 isn't too difficult to work with as compared to the much smaller [PS One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_models#PS_One). It has been a year and half since I did this mod, and it still works perfectly! It's also very inexpensive: apart from $20 I paid for the console itself, I paid a total of about $6 for the Pro Mini and the FT232RL driver.
