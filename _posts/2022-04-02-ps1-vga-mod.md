A while ago, I [modded my PS1 with the PsNee]({% post_url 2022-03-31-psnee-mod %}), which was really great, but one thing that I wanted to improve was the video output quality when playing on my modern TV. The PS1 natively outputs composite video by default, and can output RGB, but you [need to buy an expensive cable](https://www.retrorgb.com/playstation1.html) to access it. At some point, I stumbled upon [this blog post](https://bitbuilt.net/forums/index.php?threads/ps1-native-vga-mod-15khz.4118/) by Wesk that describes how he modded his PS1 to output 15Khz RGBHV via a DE-15 VGA-style connector. This would be perfect for me as the [gbs-control]({% post_url 2022-04-01-gbs-control %}) scaler I built can accept such a signal.

## Plan

While waiting on the pack of 5 VGA connectors I ordered from AliExpress for about $7, I opened up my PS1 to determine where I'd need to solder to. Wesk's PS1 in his post is a model SCPH-5502, while mine is a SCPH-7501 (PU-23), so the layout is not the same. I took a photo of my board, and using [this service manual](https://www.manualslib.com/manual/448343/Playstation-Scph-7501-Game-Console.html?page=1), I marked the points I'd need to tap into:

## The Build

So now it was time to solder wires to the board. Note that in Wesk's post, he uses coaxial wires for the RGB signals to [shield them from noise](https://bitbuilt.net/forums/index.php?threads/ps1-native-vga-mod-15khz.4118/page-2#post-51800). I didn't have any coax wires, so I decided to just use regular wire and see what happens.

Using my marked up photo from above, I went ahead and soldered six wires.

Three for RGB:

One for ground:

And two for horizontal and vertical sync:

All together it looked like this:

Once I received the VGA connectors, I realized I had made a mistake! Instead of ordering female connectors, I had ordered male ones:

Oops! I went ahead and ordered the correct ones from AliExpress, and while waiting, I realized I owned a VGA extension cable, which has one male end and one female end, and that I could use it with a male connector. So being impatient, I decided to temporarily move ahead with the male connector and extension cable, and replace it later with the female connector and a regular VGA cable.

Someone on original post shared this useful pic of where to solder to the VGA connector:

Since I was using a male connector with an extension cable, I needed to mirror my connections horizontally. I soldered the wires to the connector:

And now it was time to test it. I hooked up the extension cable into the gbs-control with HDMI out to my TV:

Success!

Next, using my desoldering gun, I desoldered the serial port from the PS1 to have a place for the VGA connector:

Since I was waiting on the female VGA connector to finish up, I left the connector hanging out of the serial port slot with some wire tape to keep it roughly in place:

A couple of weeks later, I received the female connectors from AliExpress:

My friend also 3D-printed the bracket designed by Wesk to hold the connector in place:

![](/assets/images/ps1-vga-mod/IMG_5184.jpg)

I opened up the PS1 again, and desoldered the wires from the male connector and soldered to the female one, mirroring the connections horizontally:

![](/assets/images/ps1-vga-mod/IMG_5188.jpg)

The 3D-printed bracket fit perfectly:

But like Wesk describes in his post, the RF shield needs to be cut to allow the bracket to fit. I don't own a Dremel (yet), so I used some large cutters and pliers to cut the shield:

![](/assets/images/ps1-vga-mod/IMG_5204.jpg)

![](/assets/images/ps1-vga-mod/IMG_5205.jpg)

Perfect fit! Now I could button up the console:

It looks almost stock when all closed up! I will say, though, that when connecting a VGA cable, it doesn't go all the way in; however, there's enough of a grip on the pins that it's not really a problem. It's worth mentioning that this only outputs video, so you still need to connect the regular multiout cable to get the left and right audio signals.

## Comparison shots

What's cool about this mod is that you can still output the composite signal at the same time as the RGBHV signal. I took some photos of my TV with my phone to compare the two (left is composite, right is RGBHV):

The difference is really obvious. The RGBHV output is clean and crisp, and perfect for playing on LCD screens.

## Thoughts

This was a fun mod, and not too difficult. I definitely recommend it if you don't want to spend a lot of money on component cables for the PS1. I've been playing a bunch of classic PS1 games on my 70" TV since I did this, and am loving it!
