My name is Antonio Maiorano, aka Daroou2, and I'm a programmer, retro-console lover, and tinkerer. I've been writing code since about 1997, mostly games, and mostly in C++. In recent years, I've written a couple of emulators: first a NES emulator, [nes-emu](https://github.com/amaiorano/nes-emu), and then an emulator for the somewhat obscure vector-based console known as the Vectrex, named [Vectrexy](https://github.com/amaiorano/vectrexy). You can actually watch me develop Vectrexy [live on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/daroou2), all of which has been archived on [my YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/daroou2). In recent years, I've gotten into modding retro consoles, and [electronics]({% link tags.md %}#Electronics) in general.
